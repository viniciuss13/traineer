          With Christmas close and Team Cherry about to take a few days off
          after an intensive year’s development, we’re gonna try and keep this
          update as snap-sharp as we can.

          Silksong Development Progress

        <p class="home_banner_text">
          Right up front: We’re still going, building this (very large) game.
          Our desire to keep building, and building, and building sure hasn’t
          diminished, but our timelines have stretched a bit both to account for
          all that exciting new stuff and to tie up everything else.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a small progress tease: You may remember for Silksong we promised
          over 150 all new enemies. To us, that always seemed a conservative
          estimate, and it turns out we were right! Here are just a few foes
          that came to life this week, enemy number 163, 164 and 165.

          Though their names shall remain a mystery, we can say they’re members
          of a scholarly suite, former tenders of a dusty vault full of ancient
          knowledge. This is a tough later game trio who, when in battle, work
          closely together, covering for each other’s weaknesses.
          <br />
          <br />
          And as some assurance: We’re not just randomly building things without
          an end in site. We know how this story unfolds and as much as we add,
          our intent is always to evoke the feeling of exploring a vast,
          surprising new world; one that matches (or exceeds) the scale and
          diversity of the original game.
          <br />
          <br />
          We can’t wait to one day talk about all the wild evolutions to this
          new world that’ve taken place behind the scenes, but that day’ll have
          to wait until after the game is out and in your hands.
